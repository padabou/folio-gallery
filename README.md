# folio-gallery
This project is a fork of https://www.foliopages.com/foliogallery/ with some responsive improvment

## Overview
folioGallery is an easy to use gallery written by Harry G of foliopages.com.  Just drop it on your PHP web server and edit ``foliogallery.php`` to point the ``$mainFolder`` variable to the location of your pictures you want hosted.  If you are like me, this makes it super easy to turn your pile of home pictures into a browsable website in just a few minutes!
